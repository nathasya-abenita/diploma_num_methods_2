\section{Class 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read IEEE standard for basic algorithms. Each machine has its own smallest float number that's significant (machine $\epsilon$).
    \item Sampling frequency is important because if it's too large, we can lose the real pattern of the function (for example, wave function is read as constant value if we sample at maximum points only)
    \item Lax equivalence theorem: If a \textbf{consistent}, linear method is \textbf{stable}, it will \textbf{converge}.
\end{itemize}
